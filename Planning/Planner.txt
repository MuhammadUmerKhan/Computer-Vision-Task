## Brief Planner for Tiny Object Detection Task (Building Class) ##

‚úÖ Step 1: Data Preprocessing  
  Before training, ensure the dataset is correctly formatted and ready for model training.

1Ô∏è‚É£ Filter Out Only the 'Building' Class (Class 0)
  - Focus on detecting only buildings (class `0`).
  - Remove annotations and images for other classes (A to F).
  - Modify YOLO annotation files to retain only "Building" class annotations.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Split & Verify the Data
  - Ensure the `train`, `val`, and `test` datasets are balanced.
  - Count the number of images in each split.
  - Verify that there are enough "Building" class samples for effective training.

‚úÖ Step 2: Choose the Deep Learning Model  
Select a suitable object detection approach for the task.

üîπ Option 1: Use a Pretrained YOLO Model (Best for Quick Results)
  - Utilize YOLOv5 or YOLOv8 models for fast training.
  - Steps:
    1. Prepare the dataset for YOLOv5/YOLOv8.
    2. Train the model on the "Building" class only.
    3. Fine-tune hyperparameters (learning rate, batch size, etc.).

üîπ Option 2: Train a Custom Object Detection Model (Using TensorFlow)
  - Convert the dataset to Pascal VOC or COCO format.
  - Train models like Faster R-CNN, EfficientDet, or SSD.
  - Monitor mAP (Mean Average Precision) during training.

üîπ Option 3: Try Vision Transformers (ViTs) for Object Detection
  - Experiment with DETR (End-to-End Object Detection with Transformers) for innovative results.

‚úÖ Step 3: Train the Model
  - Set up training scripts for the chosen model (YOLO, TensorFlow, or PyTorch).
  - Monitor training progress (track mAP, loss, precision, recall).
  - Save the trained model weights for future use.

‚úÖ Step 4: Evaluate Model Performance
  - Run inference on the test dataset.
  - Calculate mAP for the "Building" class.
  - Compare the results across different techniques, if applicable.

‚úÖ Step 5 (Optional): Build Streamlit UI
  - If desired, create a Streamlit web application.
  - Allow users to upload images and visualize bounding boxes around detected buildings.
